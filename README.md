# Nice login form

Playing around to get a funny login form using only JS and CSS (no images).

Inspired by [https://github.com/addyosmani/tunnel-bear-login](Tunnel Bear Login Animation by Addy Osmani) which is based in [https://www.tunnelbear.com/account/login](the Tunnel Bear by Kadri Jibraan).

The cat is also inspired by [https://codingartistweb.com/2023/03/cat-css-art/](Cat CSS Art by Coding Artist).
      
I know. A lot of inspiration here...
