# Nice login form

Playing around to get a funny login form using only JS and CSS (no images).

[See the live demo here](https://adripanico.github.io/nice-login-form/).

Inspired by [Tunnel Bear Login Animation by Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/tunnel-bear-login) which is based in [the Tunnel Bear by Kadri Jibraan](https://www.tunnelbear.com/account/login).

The cat is also inspired by [Cat CSS Art by Coding Artist](https://codingartistweb.com/2023/03/cat-css-art/).

I know. A lot of inspiration here...
